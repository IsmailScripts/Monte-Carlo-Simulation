# Monte-Carlo-Simulation

This project, built for our Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDC) course, implements a Monte Carlo Simulation for stock price prediction using Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM). Developed in C with MPI for distributed processing and GMP for high-precision arithmetic, it features both serial and parallel versions. The simulation models stock price movements over 90 million paths and 252 time steps, calculating key statistics like mean and standard deviation. The project emphasizes performance optimization, scalability, and precision. By leveraging MPI, it distributes computation efficiently across multiple processes to reduce execution time and handle large-scale simulations. The use of GMP ensures high-precision calculations for statistical outputs, making the results reliable for financial modeling
